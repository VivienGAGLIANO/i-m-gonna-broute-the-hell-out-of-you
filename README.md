# i-m-gonna-broute-the-hell-out-of-you

Game developed during the [GMTK2020](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020), with the theme : **Out of Control**

## Gameplay

Your horse has spent his life, with you on its back, eating some grass. He's fed up of it, and now wants to taste a bite of your thighs. (Yes, he saw when you ate some of his peers with a *muchmuchgood* b√©chamel.)

Your mission, if you accept it, is to show him than vegetarism is the way, by feeding him the goodest "Carotte d'Or" (golden carrot). While escaping his jaws. But, hey, you didn't change yet. Your helmet might be in the way, but it's a legacy of your grandpapa, so deal with it !

Btw, your horse might not be much of a fan of carrots.


The character is moving on its own, but you can give him orders. When his helmet is on his head, you can tell him to switch direction (left or right, by clicking). When it is under his feet, you can make him jump (click) or crouch (hold). If you find a carrot in a level, you can slow down the horse. If it reaches you, it's restart time !

**Ctrl** : Switch run mode (Left/right --- Jump/Crouch)  
**X** : Go left / Jump  
**C** : Go right / Crouch  
**Q** : Throw carrot
